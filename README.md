### REST API display exercise

#### 1) Get and present the data of user with id 4. Develop using fetchâ€¦then. The display of the results must be handled by a function.

#### 2) Modify the code written in exercise 1 to use the async/await structure (copy the function that displays the results on the page). Use try catch to prevent system failures.

#### 3) Use fetch to do a post request to the same backend server and log the results or the errors.
